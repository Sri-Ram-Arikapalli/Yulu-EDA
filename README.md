## Yulu-EDA
1) Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared electric cycles in the Indian market?
2) How well those variables describe the electric cycle demands

## Insights
1) The data is given from Timestamp('2011-01-01 00:00:00') to Timestamp('2012-12-19 23:00:00'). The total time period for which the data is given is '718 days 23:00:00'.
2) Out of every 100 users, around 19 are casual users and 81 are registered users.
3) The mean total hourly count of rental bikes is 144 for the year 2011 and 239 for the year 2012. An annual growth rate of 65.41 % can be seen in the demand of electric vehicles on an hourly basis.
4) There is a seasonal pattern in the count of rental bikes, with higher demand during the spring and summer months, a slight decline in the fall, and a further decrease in the winter months.
5) The average hourly count of rental bikes is the lowest in the month of January followed by February and March.
6) There is a distinct fluctuation in count throughout the day, with low counts during early morning hours, a sudden increase in the morning, a peak count in the afternoon, and a gradual decline in the evening and nighttime.
7) More than 80 % of the time, the temperature is less than 28 degrees celcius.
8) More than 80 % of the time, the humidity value is greater than 40. Thus for most of the time, humidity level varies from optimum to too moist.
9) More than 85 % of the total, windspeed data has a value of less than 20.
10) The hourly count of total rental bikes is the highest in the clear and cloudy weather, followed by the misty weather and rainy weather. There are very few records for extreme weather conditions.
